# Inbreeding-Checker
This program checks which animals within a group may breed with one another and returns the result for a given individual.

TODO (for alpha 0.1.0):

    1. Prevent the program recommending partners of the same sex.
    2. Add the ability to insert new animals.
    3. Add the ability to create and link new sheets to an individual, so that individuals may be given multiple relatives.
    4. Add the ability to add relationship distances from an individual (cousin, sibling, parent, etc).
    5. Add an "incest formula" for more accurate breeding recommendations.
